Code examples for First Steps with Ajax
=======================================

There are four Java classes in two packages, under src:

developerworks.ajax.store:
  Cart.java - A simple shopping cart representation, with a toXml() method.
  Catalog.java - Has details of the products available in the store
  Item.java - Represents an item in the product catalog

developerworks.ajax.servlet:
  CartServlet.java -  Updates a session-held Cart object, and outputs its XML
                      representation

The web directory contains three files:

  index.jsp - Renders the initial page, including an empty cart, and a list of
              items in the catalog.

  ajax1.js  - Contains the general-purpose Ajax functions shown in the article.

  cart.js   - Javascript functions specific to the shopping-cart example.

web.xml contains deployment information for the web-app.
