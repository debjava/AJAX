A Simple HTTP Request Example
Let's first revise the flow of making an HTTP request in JavaScript, and handling the response. This is just a quick example to refresh your memory. For all the spicy details, see SitePoint's introductory article, AJAX: Usable Interactivity with Remote Scripting.

Our JavaScript will request an HTML document, test.html, which contains the text "I'm a test." We'll then alert() the contents of the test.html file.

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"> 

   var http_request = false; 

   function makeRequest(url) { 

       if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // Mozilla, Safari,... 
           http_request = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
       } else if (window.ActiveXObject) { // IE 
           http_request = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); 
       } 
       http_request.onreadystatechange = alertContents; 
       http_request.open('GET', url, true); 
       http_request.send(null); 

   } 

   function alertContents() { 

       if (http_request.readyState == 4) { 
           if (http_request.status == 200) { 
               alert(http_request.responseText); 
           } else { 
               alert('There was a problem with the request.'); 
           } 
       } 

   } 
</script> 
<a href="#" onclick="makeRequest('test.html')">Make a request</a>

Here's how this example works:


The user clicks the link "Make a request" in the browser. 
This calls the makeRequest() function with a parameter: the name of an HTML file in the same directory. In this case, it's test.html. 
The request is made. 
The onreadystatechange event fires and the execution is passed to alertContents(). 
alertContents() checks if the response was received and, if it's OK, then alert()s the contents of the test.html file.
